initial exemple of what this course should contain, breaked into 3 levels, please help in on the filling.

I chose PHP as the initial server-side language because i'm confused about something :  if we put fullstackjs in the part time, won't everyone just choose the part-time advanced track instead of the full-time ?   
So I let it PHP for now so they can understand high-level server side functionnalities easily.
